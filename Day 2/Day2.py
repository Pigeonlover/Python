# Subscripting


# Can use negative number for position, and it will go backwards
print("Hello"[-5]) # Prints last letter

# To write large integers, include _ instead of , to make them easier to read
print(10_500)

# Check data type
print(type(True))

# Convert data type with casting
int("45") # Converts string '45' into an integer
float()
str()
bool()
# Etc... Some things cannot be converted
